# Solution for Q1

1. The page-replacement algorithm should be defined as follows:
   1. The initial value of the counters is 0.
   2. A counter is increased if there is a new page associated with the frame.
   3. A counter is decreased if there is a page that is not needed and can be freed.
   4. A page is selected when the frame has the smallest counter.

2. The page fault count for the the algorithm is 14.

3. The page fault count for the OPT algorithm is 11.
